# 3d models

All STLs are based on the same [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) file I used to create the animations in the video. The model in the blend file is based on a 3d model exported from KiCad, which I converted using FreeCAD. So, most of the components are from the KiCad libraries while I got the Pro Micro from the [Spark Fun KiCad Libraries](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-KiCad-Libraries) combined with a [3d model by Andrew Whitham](https://grabcad.com/library/arduino-pro-micro-1) for the Pro Micro.

The knob version with a finger dimple (know_with_dimple.stl) is by Roland Irving.
