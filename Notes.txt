I intend to have a range of dynamically selectable screens, as opposed to fixed by process:
I need to make a new mode for assessing modes, setting the "fallback" to a mode selector.

This may need the creation of a new "mode" variable, although the definition of the likes of "activeWindow" does not appear to take place at the start, but further down.

There is a debate over whether to use a separate type of mode or inner functions to define separate screens within a mode, but hey *shrug*.
I will also need a way of getting back "up" a mode which may prove difficult, or of dynamically changing modes.
    How to create a _truly_ global variable?
